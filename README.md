# PyStruct
This repository is build to help structural engineers make simple and more complex calculations. The software should be able to perform static and dynamic analysis using bar and beam elements. Linear and non-linear solvers will be included . Additionally,  a Graphic User Interface (GUI) will be part of the repo.
